# Project 1: Queries and Indices

This project aims to demonstrate a process of using a database, including creating database, preparing queries, explore different indices.

These are the steps we follow:

- Extract data from a xml file (dblp.xml) as csv files
- Create a database
- Load data to the database
- Writing queries for the questions
- Explore the influences of the indices on tables
- Explore the influence of different cache size on query execution speed 


## Project 2: Postgresql Query Description and Explanation

This project aims to provide an algorithm to describe the query eexecution plan (QEP) generated for each query, draw the QEP as a tree structure, describe the difference in QEPs of similar queries and generate the reason of the changing of the QEP.

This project's purpose is to enhance the beginner's learning expereience of realtional database management systems. Through the visualizing the QEP by both text format and tree structure formate, the learner will be albe to get the idea of QEP easier. By providing the difference of the QEP for 2 similari queries and providing the reason of the changes, the learner will be able to have a good understanding of how a optimized QEP is generated.
